# Pine64 Pinephone documentation
The source code for the pinephone build is complete except for the build file (.gni). I will finish it when I have time, UART / serial should work out of the box if it boots. 

You can find the sources code [here](https://github.com/EnderNightLord-ChromeBook/fuchsia-pine64-pinephone/blob/master/zircon/kernel/target/arm64/board/pinephone-1.2/boot-shim-config.h)

## Information about the port
* boots with 1 GB of ram
* boots with 2 cores running
* should boot with a serial driver out of the box

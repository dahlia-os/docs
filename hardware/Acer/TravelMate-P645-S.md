# Acer TravelMate P645-S documentation

Note: This is not an officially supported device for the zircon version, only for the linux version.

- The builds from 201004 onwards can run on it by default
- For the BIOS you can download and install **v1.20** [here](https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/BIOS/BIOS/BIOS_Acer_1.20_A_A.zip?acerid=636815760869299568&Step1=NOTEBOOK&Step2=TRAVELMATE&Step3=TRAVELMATE%20P645-S&OS=10M1&LC=en&BC=ACER&SC=AAP_1).

This is recommended as there are a number of system improvements.

## Known problems

## Install

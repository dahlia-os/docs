## How to make a bootable USB(NON GRUB)(FEW DEVICES)

Firstly, you wanna check if you have one of the few supported devices [here](https://github.com/dahlia-os/documentation/blob/master/supported%20hardware%20non%20grub.md).
If so you can download a dahliaOS iso from the [releases page](https://github.com/dahlia-os/releases/releases). The latest one at the time of writing can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/dahlia-os/releases/releases/download/200630.1-x86_64/dahliaOS-200630_2.iso)

Secondly, download and install [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).  

After that run Etcher, select your dahlia iso, then your USB device, then select flash!

After the process is finished, rebot and select you USB from you boot menu. 

(you may need to change your boot order in your uefi first.)
